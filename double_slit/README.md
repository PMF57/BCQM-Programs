# Double-slit simulation

Simulation used to generate interference patterns, histograms, and comparisons with incoherent sums.

## Usage
```bash
python double_slit_sim.py -h   # if CLI options are available
# or simply
python double_slit_sim.py
```

Large outputs are not tracked; re-run to reproduce figures.
